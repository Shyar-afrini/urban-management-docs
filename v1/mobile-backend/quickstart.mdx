## Start a local server

Create a local copy of your **Urban Management** monorepo to start customizing.

### 1st Step: Cloning the project

Clone the repository by copying and pasting this into your terminal.

```bash repository clone script wrap
git clone https://github.com/dilshad-khalil/urban-managment.git
```

<Note>Make sure you have permissions to access the repository</Note>

### 2nd Step: Installing dependencies

We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to initialize the monorepo

**Run the following command in the terminal**

```bash dependency install script wrap
pnpm install
```

<Info>
  This command will install all the dependencies into the root node_modules
