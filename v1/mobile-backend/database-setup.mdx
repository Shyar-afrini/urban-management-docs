### What we Use?

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is used as a database service to initialize both the central and mobile databases.

start by clicking the **get started** button to create a new database

<Note>
  We need to create two different databases for mobile and central backends
</Note>

### Environment variables

After you have created both mobile and central databases you should insert them as follows into a **.env** file in the **central-backend** folder

```bash .env
PRIMARY_DATABASE_URL=<Your-central-db-credentials>
MOBILE_DATABASE_URL=<Your-mobile-db-credentials>
```

### Database Migration

After you set the environment variables you may set them inside the **database** package as well

- Change directory

```bash
cd ./packages/database
```

- Generate primary and mobile databases

```bash generate migrations
pnpm run drizzle:generate:primary
```

```bash generate migrations
pnpm run drizzle:generate:mobile
```

- Apply both mobile and primary databases

```bash apply migrations
pnpm run drizzle:migrate:primary
```

```bash apply migrations
pnpm run drizzle:migrate:mobile
```

- Finally build the package

```bash build database package
pnpm run build
```
