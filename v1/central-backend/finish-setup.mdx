## Run Needed services

<Tip>We need to run both the backend and dashboard at the same time</Tip>

Start running the backend service by pasting the following command in the root directory terminal path

```bash backend start command
pnpm run start:primary-backend
```

Start the Dashboard service by pasting this command into the terminal

```bash dashboard start command
pnpm run start:dashboard
```
